YouTubeBookmarks

====================================

Chrome Extension that allows users to "bookmark" their YouTube videos for later viewing.
The key feature of this extension will be the ability to save the time in the video at which
you stopped watching so as to allow the user to pickup watching right where they left off without
having to poke around and guess where they were last.
